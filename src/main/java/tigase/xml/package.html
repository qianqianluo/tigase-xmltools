<H2>Simple <em>XML</em> parser implementation.</H2>
<p>This package contains simple <em>XML</em> parser implementation. The main
    idea was to create lightweight parser supporting multithreaded processing with
    special focus on efficiency. So it supports only basic <em>XML</em>
    structures but enough for many simple cases like parsing <em>XML</em> streams
    from network connections, processing <em>XML</em> files containing
    configuration or for simple <em>XML</em> data base implementation.</p>
<p>Base classes define and implement <em>SAX</em> style parser:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>SimpleParser</code> - implementation of <em>SAX</em> parser. This
        is very basic implementation of <em>XML</em> parser designed especially to
        be light and parse <em>XML</em> streams like jabber <em>XML</em> stream. It
        is very efficient, capable of parsing parts of <em>XML</em> document
        received from the network connection as well as handling a few <em>XML</em>
        documents in one buffer. This is especially useful when parsing data
        received from the network. Packets received from the network can contain non-complete
        <em>XML</em> document as well as a few complete <em>XML</em> documents. It
        doesn't support <em>XML</em> comments, processing instructions, document
        inclusions. Actually it supports only:
        <ul>
            <li>Start element event (with all attributes found).</li>
            <li>End element even.</li>
            <li>Character data event.</li>
            <li>'Other-XML' data event - everything between '&#60;' and '&#62;' if after
                &#60; is '?' or '!'. So it can 'catch' doc-type declaration, processing
                instructions but it can't process correctly commented blocks.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Although very simple this implementation is sufficient for Jabber
        protocol needs and is even used by some other packages of this server like
        implementation of <code>UserRepository</code> based on <em>XML</em> file or
        server configuration.
        <p>It is worth to note also that this class is fully thread safe. It means that
            one instance of this class can be simultaneously used by many threads. This
            is to improve resources usage when processing many client connections at
            the same time.</p>
    </li>
    <li><code>SimpleHandler</code> - parser handler interface for event driven
        parser. It is very simplified version of
        <code>org.xml.sax.ContentHandler</code> interface created for
        <code>SimpleParser</code> needs. It allows to receive events like start
        element (with element attributes), end element, element c-data, other <em>XML</em>
        content and error event if <em>XML</em> error found.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Based on above <em>SAX</em> parser there is also <em>DOM</em>
    implementation. Classes used to build <em>DOM</em> for <em>XML</em> content
    are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>DomBuilderHandler</code> - implementation of
        <code>SimpleHandler</code> building <em>DOM</em> structures during parsing
        time. It also supports creation of multiple, sperate document trees if parsed
        buffer contains a few <em>XML</em> documents. As a result of work it returns
        always <code>Queue</code> containing all found <em>XML</em> trees in the
        same order as they were found in network data.<br>
        Document trees created by this <em>DOM</em> builder consist of instances of
        <code>Element</code> class or instances of class extending
        <code>Element</code> class. To receive trees built with instances of proper
        class user must provide <code>ElementFactory</code> implementation creating
        instances of required <code>ELement</code> extension.
    </li>
    <li><code>Element</code> - basic document tree node implementation.
        Supports Java 5.0 generic types to make it easier to extend and
        still preserve some useful functionality. Sufficient for simple cases but
        probably in the most more advanced cases should be extended with additional
        features. Look in API documentation for more details and information about
        existing extensions. The most important features apart from obvious tree
        implementation are:
        <ul>
            <li><code>toString()</code> implementation so it can generate valid
                <em>XML</em> content from this element and all children.
            </li>
            <li><code>addChild(...)</code>, <code>getChild(childName)</code> supporting
                generic types.
            </li>
            <li><code>findChild(childPath)</code> finding child in subtree by given
                path to element.
            </li>
            <li><code>getChildCData(childPath)</code>, <code>getAttribute(childPath,
                attName)</code> returning element c-data or attribute from child in
                subtree by given path to element.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><code>ElementFactory</code> is interface definition for factories
        creating proper instances of <code>Element</code> class or its extension.
    </li>
    <li><code>DefaultElementFactory</code> is an <code>ElementFactory</code>
        implementation creating instances of basic <code>Element</code> class. This
        implementation exists to offer complementary implementation of
        <em>DOM</em>. It can be used when basic <code>Element</code> class is
        sufficient for particular needs.
    </li>
    <li><code>SingletonFactory</code> provides a way to use only one instance of
        <code>SimpleParser</code> in all your code.
        Since <code>SimpleParser</code> if fully thread safe implementation there is
        no sense to use multiple instances of this class. This in particular useful
        when processing a lot of network connections sending <em>XML</em> streams
        and using one instance for all connections can save some resources.<br>
        Of course it is still possible to create as many instances of
        <code>SimpleParser</code> you like in normal way using public constructor.
    </li>
</ul>
