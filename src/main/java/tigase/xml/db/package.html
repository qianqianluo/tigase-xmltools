<H2>This package contains implementation of simple data base stored in <em>XML</em> file.</H1>
<p>This data base implementation is very simple but also very handy. It simple
    because it reads whole data base file into memory to operate on data. It
    allows to store and retrieve only text or character string data.<br>
    Data base is kept in <em>XML</em> file. This gives us a few nice benefits:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>First of all this is hierachical data base so you can organize your data in
        tree like structures. It looks like a file system directory structure and
        you also operate on it in very similar way.
    </li>
    <li>Second it allows you to assign any number of values to one key. They are
        called <em>data lists</em>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>As a whole data base is kept in memory it is not good for storring large
    number of data in one file. But it is very fast. It is good especially for
    storring configuration or data which are similar in their nature to
    <em>LDAP</em> supporting data bases. You don't have to worry about saving
    data. Each time you add new item to data base it take care about saving them
    to permanent storage.</p>
<p><code>XMLDB</code> is the main data base access class.
    It allows you to create new data base in given file, open data base from
    given file, add, delete and retrieve data and data lists. All data or data
    lists are stored in data base nodes. There are three possible kinds of nodes
    for each data base:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>root node</b> - this is top node in each <em>XML</em> hierachy tree.
        There can be only one root node in data base as there can be only one root
        element in <em>XML</em> file. The element name for root node can be defined
        by the user when new data base is created or defualt element name
        '<code>root</code>' is used.
    </li>
    <li><b>node1 nodes</b> - these are the first level nodes under <em>root</em>
        node. There can be any number of nodes on this level. All data added for
        this data base are added to first level node unless subnode path is
        given. User can define element name of <em>node1</em> when new data base is
        created. If not given default element name '<code>node</code>' is used.
    </li>
    <li><b>subnodes</b> - node on any deeper level under <em>node1</em>
        level. There can be any number of <em>subnodes</em> on any
        level. <em>Subnodes</em> has always '<code>node</code>' element name and this can't
        be changed.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>All <em>node1</em> nodes and <em>subnodes</em> can contains any number of
    data associated with keys. With some keys there ca be more than one value
    assigned. Such kind of data are called <em>data lists</em>.<br>
    Although element name for <em>subnode</em> can not be defined it is actually not
    important. Because data base user doesn't use subnode element names. He doesn't
    even use neiher <em>root</em> node element name nor <em>node1</em> element
    name. Data base user uses <em><b>node name</b></em> what is quite different
    from <b><em>node element name</em></b>. Let see example below:</p>
<pre>&lt;node name='roster'/&#62;</pre>
<p>In this example <em>node element name</em> is <b>node</b> and
    <em>node name</em> is <b>roster.</b><br>
    Data base users (actually developers) use only <em>node names</em>.<br>
    If you want to access subnode on some level you need to give full path to
    this subnode. For example, let's assume we have following data base:</p>
<pre>  &lt;;node name='tigase'&gt;
   &lt;node name='server'&gt;
   &lt;/node&gt;
   &lt;node name='xmpp'&gt;
   &lt;/node&gt;
  &lt;/node&gt;</pre>
<p>If you need to access '<code>server</code>' subnode you need to call method
    with '<code>/tigase/server</code>' as subnode path and for subnode
    '<code>xmpp</code>' proper subnode path is of course
    '<code>/tigase/xmpp</code>'. If you skip subnode path or give
    <code>null</code> as a parameter you will be accessing data on <em>node1</em>
    level. You can not access or save data on root node level.</p>
<p><code>DBElement</code> class extends <code>tigase.xml.Element</code>. It
    adds some extra functionality useful for data base operations like searching
    for some specific nodes, add data entries, remove data, and all other common
    operations not directly related to pure <em>XML</em> processing. Pure
    <em>XML</em> processing is of course implemented in
    <code>tigase.xml.Element</code>. The are also some methods which make it
    easier to save <em>XML</em> tree from memory to disk file in a form which is
    easier to read by a human.</p>
<p><code>DBElementFactory</code> is implementation of factory design pattern
    required by <em>XML</em> <em>DOM</em> builder to create proper
    <code>Element</code> instances for tree nodes.</p>
